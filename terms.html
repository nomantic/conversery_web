                    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                    <p><strong>Effective Date: July 12, 2025</strong></p>
                    <p>Welcome to Conversery! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
                        Conversery mobile application ("App"), the website conversery.com ("Website"), and any services,
                        features, and content offered.</p>

                    <h2>1. The Service Provider</h2>
                    <p>The Service is owned and operated by Noman sardar, a sole proprietor, doing business as
                        Conversery ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between
                        you and Noman sardar.</p>
                    <p>By accessing, downloading, or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do
                        not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

                    <h2>2. Eligibility and User Accounts</h2>
                    <p><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you
                        are under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction), you must have your
                        parent or legal guardian's permission to use the Service, and they must read and agree to these
                        Terms on your behalf.</p>
                    <p><strong>Registration:</strong> You can create an account using your email address, a Google
                        account, or by using the Service anonymously. You agree to provide accurate and complete
                        information when creating an account.</p>
                    <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under
                        your account, whether or not you have authorized them. You must keep your account credentials
                        confidential and notify us immediately at support@conversery.com of any unauthorized use of your
                        account.</p>

                    <h2>3. Description of the Service</h2>
                    <p>The Service is a language learning platform that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate
                        content such as stories, conversations, quiz lessons, flashcards, and grammar analysis to aid in
                        your language learning journey.</p>
                    <p>The features of the Service are currently available for free. Access to some features may be
                        gated by a "Star Points" system. Star Points are a virtual in-app currency that can be earned
                        for free by performing actions within the App, such as watching advertisements or completing
                        lessons.</p>

                    <h2>4. Future Changes to the Service and Pricing</h2>
                    <p>We expressly reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any
                        time, with or without notice.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we reserve the right to introduce new monetization models in the future. This may
                        include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introducing paid subscription plans (e.g., monthly or annually).</li>
                        <li>Moving features that are currently free to a premium/paid tier.</li>
                        <li>Introducing in-app purchases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Should we introduce paid features, the terms related to billing, payments processed through the
                        Google Play Store or other platforms, automatic renewals, and our refund policy will be updated.
                        We will provide notice of such changes within the App or via email.</p>

                    <h2>5. AI-Generated Content</h2>
                    <p><strong>Nature of Content:</strong> The learning materials you interact with in the App,
                        including stories, conversations, and analyses ("Content"), are generated by third-party
                        artificial intelligence models.</p>
                    <p><strong>License to You:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a
                        broad, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, copy, and modify the Content generated

                    <p><strong>License to Us:</strong> To enable the functionality of the Service, you grant us a
                        license to store and process the prompts you enter and the Content that is generated for you.

                    <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
                    <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service itself—including the Conversery and

                        and materials (excluding AI-Generated Content as defined in Section 5)—are and will remain the
                        exclusive property of Noman sardar (doing business as Conversery).</p>
                    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for
                        your personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms. You may not copy, modify,

                    <h2>9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p><strong>Warranty Disclaimer:</strong> The Service is provided "AS-IS" and "AS-AVAILABLE,"

                        the laws of Italy, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent
                        courts located in Milan, Italy (Corte d'Appello di Milano) to resolve any legal matter arising

                    <p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> We encourage you to contact us at support@conversery.com to
                        resolve any issue before seeking formal legal action. Should a dispute arise, we will attempt to
